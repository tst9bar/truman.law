			<h1>Chay’s Inn</h1>

			<section>
				<p>Welcome to this modest inn, dear traveller. Here I set down the preoccupations which presently animate my mind, those of a legal tint with a tincture of whimsy.</p>
				<p>Within these walls you shall find injudicious intuitions, half-baked thoughts, bitty texts, pre-drafts, and, on occasion, a playful gambol with words. In the parlance of the modern Internet, this is my legal garden.

					<span class="marginnote">The notion of digital gardening as articulated by Mike Caufield in 2015 is founded upon the vision of the hypertext pioneer Mark Bernstein, whose contributions date to the nascent days of the Internet. The concept took off during the course 2019 and early 2020 (and unfortunately evolves into the current stage of the nonsense Obsidian-y cult). Its historical context and development are documented in Maggie Appleton's <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history">summary</a>.<br><br>A digital garden, in contrast to the conventional website composed of linear succession of timeline events, is an exploratory collection of information or thoughts, each richly interlinked with others. By way of an obvious metaphor, the ideas within such a garden may bud, flourish or wither as time unfolds. What truly matters is the act of planting those ideas (by publishing them, however unfinished) and (diligently) tending them in the garden.</span>
